# 🚗 Carpooled - Carpooling. Made Easy

Carpooled is an open-source app by which everyone can share their car journey so that more than one person travels in a car, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves. By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person's travel costs such as: fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. <br><br>
It is a full stack application, users can register, login, make their own carpool, join other's carpool and many more! <br>
Carpooled is live and hosted with REPL - **https://carpooled.guptasajal411.repl.co/**

# 💡 Inspiration
We all know that carpooling can save fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emmisions. But it is always difficult to find a buddy specially if you are short on time. So I thought about making an application where all carpools will be listed and users can browse them, join one or even create their own carpool!

# 🥳 Features
✅ New users can register for Carpooled <br>
✅ Allows users to login and logout <br>
✅ Allows users to browse carpools created by others <br>
✅ Users can make their own carpool <br>
✅ users can join other's carpool, check out the members <br>
✅ Users can also leave the carpool <br>
✅ Users can delete their own carpool if they have to  <br>
✅ Minimal, glassmorphism UI

# 🧐 Technologies used
- Frontend: Basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I also used Bootstrap for keeping the app simple and responsive.
- Backend: Node.js & Express.js for creating new routes, handling GET and POST requests, and performing CRUD operations on databases.
- Database: I have used MongoDB Atlas for remote database, and Mongoose for modelling the application data.
